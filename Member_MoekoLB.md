# Hello world!

This file is intended to practice a little bit our skills on **GitHub**. I will ask you some questions and you can answer it with the truth or playing with fantasy answers. The questions are not intended to steal your password (but this is _exactly_ what a person trying to steal your password would say 👀). I hope you enjoy the task.

- What's your name? *Moe's*
- What did you have for dinner yesterday? 🌶️ 🍕
- What's the color of your shoes? **guess**
- Where do you want your next trip to be? [The best country in the world ❤️](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan)

Great! You accomplished your task 🎉. Now save this file and follow the remaining instructions.
