# Hello world!

This file is intended to practice a little bit our skills on **GitHub**. I will ask you some questions and you can answer it with the truth or playing with fantasy answers. The questions are not intended to steal your password (but this is _exactly_ what a person trying to steal your password would say 👀). I hope you enjoy the task.
